Prerequisites
=============

You need to have Python 2.2 or higher (Python 2.3 is required for
MS Windows Tray Module). You can download Python from
<http://www.python.org/download/>.

You also need version 2.4.2.4 of the wxPython package. Please do
not use wxPython 2.5 as the code is not yet compatible. You need
to apply the following patches that fix some bugs in wxPython:
clamwin/patches/wxPython-2424.maskededit.patch
clamwin/patches/wxPython-2424.throbber.patch
clamwin/patches/wxPython-2424.timectrl.patch

For the MS Windows Tray Module and Outlook Addin you also need to
have the pywin32 extensions  installed (pywin32-203 or above),
which you can get from <http://starship.python.net/crew/mhammond>.

For Windows98 version, where there is no balloon notifications you need to build
clamwin/py/BalloonTip extension module with Visual C++ Toolkit 2003
(see below for instructions)

To build Outlook Addin you need to have msoutl9.tlb (version 9.0.0)
regsitered. This is part of Microsoft Office 2000. This version
is used for compatibility reasons.

To build Microsoft Windows binary files from python source
you need py2exe distutils extension  version 0.5.4 or above which you
can get from <http://starship.python.net/crew/theller/py2exe/>.

To buld Context Menu Module for Windows Explorer you need
free Visual C++ Toolkit 2003, get it from:
<http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualc/vctoolkit2003/>
Also you need Platform SDK, which you can get at
<http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/>

To build the setup program you need InnoSetup 5 or higher and
ISTool 5 or higher. You can get InnoSetup from
<http://www.jrsoftware.org/isdl.php> and ISTool from
<http://www.istool.org/downloads.aspx>

And of course you need the excellent GPL Antivirus Toolkit -
Clam Antivirus (ClamAV). You can get the latest version from www.clamav.net

To build ClamAV for MS Windows you to apply the clamav-native and
clamav-native-msvc patches found in patches directory and then use
MSVC6 or MSVC8 to build. Project files can be found in contrib/msvc
directory after applying a patch to the clamav tree


Getting the software
====================

If you don't already have it, you can download the latest release of
ClamWin for MS Windows or the source code from
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/clamwin/>.


Installation
============
For you convenience a binary package for MS Windows has been put to
SourceForge download area for the project.

If you wish to build ClamWin from the source tree then read below.

The first thing you need to do put Clam Antivirus source tree in
clamav-devel folder and build the binaries on Cygwin.
Then change directory to Setup/py2exe and run python setup_all.py, this
will put windows binary files in Setup/py2exe/dist directory.
To build the setup program you need to run
ISTool -compile <full path to the Setup.iss>. This should produce
Setup/Output/setup.exe file.

Or you may use build.bat file provided for your convenience. Please
Note that you need to edit the batch file in order to set your own
software location directories.
