***************************************
- Merged the .po files, so only 1 .po file remains per language.  The 
  performance seems to be good.  The .mo files are not stored in SVN, they
  need to be translated at build-time.
- Merged the changes up to ClamWin Free Antivirus 0.88.6 and added new strings
  to the .pot and .po files
