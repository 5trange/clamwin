- Hungarian installer was completed (Thanks KAMI)

Changes in Version ClamWinL10N-27.exe :
- Separated the installer strings from the main Setup.iss file for easier
  maintenance.  These strings are now in LANGUAGE_STRING.iss files in the 
  locale directory.
- Added Hungarian translation and prepared several string translations in
  the explorershell Message Table.

Changes in Version ClamWinL10N-27.exe :
- Merged with the trunk up to 0.88.7 (r997)
- Removed the need for trailing spaces in the translations of weekdays
  ('Mon' to 'Sun') and months ('Jan' to 'Dec')
- Allowed the Outlook Addin to not be installed (requested by lots of
  users and testers)
- Fixed the translation of the clamav version output (which displayed as
  '0,88,7' in stead of '0.88.7')

Changes in Version ClamWinL10N-26.exe :
- Changed localization in the Explorer Shell extension:
  It now uses a MessageTable resource file in stead of gettext, which 
  eliminates the need for the libintl and iconv dlls.  This works for both
  Unicode32 and Non-Unicode builds.
- Both explorer shell and Python modules can now be tested for different 
  languages by setting the string registry key "Locale" in the clamwin 
  registry tree (either in HKLM or HKCU).  Implemented values are: 
  "de_DE", "gr_GR", "en_US", "fr_FR", "pl_PL", "ko_KO", "nl_BE", "es_ES", 
  "it_IT", "ru_RU" and "zh_CN".
  The order for the choice of locale is : 
  1. Locale setting in HKCU
  2. Locale setting in HKLM
  3. Default system locale
- Changed the installer so the "International Help" component is replaced
  by a "Language Support" Component, so each user can decide which languages
  to install (language = .po file + manual + helpfile (if available)).
- Made the label field "Scan folder:" wider in the Scheduled Scan dialog.


Changes in Version ClamWinL10N-25.exe :
- Fixed a bug in the About box (didn't show because of the removed Python
  image, which left some garbage after merging)
- Moved help files and manuals to a separate clamwin\doc directory
- If the localized help file cannot be found, the english help will be
  shown in stead.
- Some small modifications to make it compile with Visual C++ 2005 Express
- Fixed the Unicode build of Explorer shell (Win64 build is still todo)
- Improved performance : A folder that took 76'19" to scan with L10N-25
  now scans in 50'31".
- Included German installer strings

Changes in Version ClamWinL10N-24.exe :
- Added string for tooltip 
  "Select if you wish to scan OLE attachments and macros in MS Office Documents"
- Fixed the "Infected Files" box on the Preferences - General tab
- Installer changes :
  * Give the user the chance to choose the installer language
  * customized messages were broken in L10N-23.  This version is compiled with 
    Inno Setup 5.2.8 and customized messages should now work.
  * Added the 6 languages to the installer for which we want a beta test.
    These are de_DE, fr_FR, nl_BE, it_IT, es_ES and ru_RU.  Strings that are
    not yet translated will appear in english.

Changes in Version ClamWinL10N-23.exe :
- Merged the .po files, so only 1 .po file remains per language.  The 
  performance seems to be good.  The .mo files are not stored in SVN, they
  need to be translated at build-time.
- Merged the changes up to ClamWin Free Antivirus 0.88.6 and added new strings
  to the .pot and .po files
