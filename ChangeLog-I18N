***************************************

  "Select if you wish to scan OLE attachments and macros in MS Office Documents"
- Fixed the "Infected Files" box on the Preferences - General tab
- Installer changes :
  * Give the user the chance to choose the installer language
  * customized messages were broken in L10N-23.  This version is compiled with 
    Inno Setup 5.2.8 and customized messages should now work.
  * Added the 6 languages to the installer for which we want a beta test.
    These are de_DE, fr_FR, nl_BE, it_IT, es_ES and ru_RU.  Strings that are
    not yet translated will appear in english.

Changes in Version ClamWinL10N-23.exe :
***************************************
- Merged the .po files, so only 1 .po file remains per language.  The 
  performance seems to be good.  The .mo files are not stored in SVN, they
  need to be translated at build-time.
- Merged the changes up to ClamWin Free Antivirus 0.88.6 and added new strings
  to the .pot and .po files
