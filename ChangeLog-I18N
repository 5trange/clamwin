* ClamWin Free Antivirus *
* I18N Branch            *
**************************

KNOWN ISSUES:
*************
- The link button to the clamav homepage in the about box is broken.
  Can't see why, it is broken in the original package too.


Changes in Version ClamWinL10N-25.exe :
***************************************
- Fixed a bug in the About box (didn't show because of the removed Python
  image, which left some garbage after merging)
- Moved help files and manuals to a separate clamwin\doc directory
- If the localized help file can not be found, the english help will be
  shown in stead.
- Some small modifications to make it compile with Visual C++ 2005 Express
- Fixed the Unicode build of Explorer shell (Win64 build is still todo)
- Improved performance : A folder that took 76'19" to scan with L10N-25
  now scans in 50'31".

Changes in Version ClamWinL10N-24.exe :
***************************************
- Added string for tooltip 
  "Select if you wish to scan OLE attachments and macros in MS Office Documents"
- Fixed the "Infected Files" box on the Preferences - General tab
- Installer changes :
  * Give the user the chance to choose the installer language
  * customized messages were broken in L10N-23.  This version is compiled with 
    Inno Setup 5.2.8 and customized messages should now work.
  * Added the 6 languages to the installer for which we want a beta test.
    These are de_DE, fr_FR, nl_BE, it_IT, es_ES and ru_RU.  Strings that are
    not yet translated will appear in english.

Changes in Version ClamWinL10N-23.exe :
***************************************
- Merged the .po files, so only 1 .po file remains per language.  The 
  performance seems to be good.  The .mo files are not stored in SVN, they
  need to be translated at build-time.
- Merged the changes up to ClamWin Free Antivirus 0.88.6 and added new strings
  to the .pot and .po files
