 - Added 60 seconds delay to 'Update DB at logon' option, so that firewall or other 
   networking software can start
 - Renamed ExplorerShell.dll to ExpShell.dll to make it 8.3 filename, inorder to make
   upgrades on 98/Me work.
   Also renamed Tray.exe (and Tray.py) to clamTray.exe (ClamTray.py) just to make the
   running executable more identifiable in the processes list.
 - Fixed a possible bug with localised version of Windows and time formatting.
 - Changed Default location after the fresh setup (not an upgrade) for Database, quarantine 
   and log folders (hopefully this is the last time):
   on Windows NT/XP/2000 C:\Documents and Settings\All Users.WINNT\.clamwin\db 
   on Windows 98/ME c:\Windows\All Users\.clamwin\db
   This is because Application Data folder is hidden in Windows 2000/XP/2003
   and some users may have difficulties finding them.   
 - Previous changelog entry (0.34) incorrectly stated that Configuration and 
   Scheduler files are stored in Common Application Data.
   Clamwin.conf and ScheduledScans files are separate for each user and stored in 
   User's Application Data directory (note that this folder is hidden in 2000/XP/2003):
   on Windows NT/XP/2000 C:\Documents and Settings\%Username%\Application Data\.clamwin
	on Windows 98/ME c:\Windows\Application Data\.clamwin.
	When a user log's on to the computer for the first time after an administrator
	installed ClamWin, this profile folder is created and Template files: Clamwin.conf
	and SheduledScans; are copied from c:\program files\clamwin\bin to the profile 
	folder (see the location above). Subsequent upgrades do not change the existing
	configuration files.
 - Database, Log and Quarantine folders are created if they don't exist before the database
   update or scan
 - Added check for Clamwin version when upgrading and refuse to upgrade if a newer
   version is already installed.

   manually. It also provides an option to configure Scan Scheduler and 
   Stop All Running Tasks

   ignored when running Scheduler

 - Configuration and scheduler files are stored in User's Application Data directory:
   on Windows NT/XP/2000 C:\Documents and Settings\%Username%\Application Data\.clamwin
	on Windows 98/ME c:\Windows\Application Data\.clamwin
 - Log files and virus database are now stored in Common Application Data directory:
   on Windows NT/XP/2000 C:\Documents and Settings\All Users.WINNT\Application Data\.clamwin
   on Windows 98/ME c:\Windows\All Users\Application Data\.clamwin
   This fixes the bug when clamwin was installed by an administrator for all 
   users and configuration was not displayed for a non-admin user.   
   The config files are migrated form old location during an upgrade and all settings 
   are preserved.
