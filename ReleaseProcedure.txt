The main purpose of this document is to have a reminder of the things to do
when building a new version of ClamWin's I18N branch.

RELEASE PROCEDURE
*****************

To Release a new build of the I18N Branch, follow these ordered steps :

1. Remove the "Fuzzy" flags from all .po files for the languages that you want to 
   be complete.  Currently these are:
      - I18N\clamwin\locale\de_DE.po
      - I18N\clamwin\locale\es_ES.po
      - I18N\clamwin\locale\fr_FR.po
      - I18N\clamwin\locale\hu_HU.po
      - I18N\clamwin\locale\nl_BE.po
   Rationale : Strings that are marked as Fuzzy will not be translated in the GUI.

2. Generate the .mo files for all languages that need to be included.  This can\
   be done by launching the "I18N\clamwin\locale\Convert.bat" script.

3. Open the I18N\clamwin\cpp\MessageTable.mc file with Notepad or another text
   editor that supports UTF-8, and check for untranslated strings that might need
   to be looked up in and copied from the .po files.

4. Open I18N\clamwin\Setup\Setup.iss with ISTool and modify the following setting:
      
      OutputBaseFileName=<Filename>

   For the <FileName>, use the format "ClamWin-0.88.7-L10N-28", where 0.88.7 is the
   official release version the branch is merged against, and 28 is the release
   version of the L10N branch (which will continue to grow until the code is generally
   accepted and we can merge the I18N branch back to the main branch).

   Optionally, you may need to add .po or .iss files for additional languages.  We 
   will describe the procedure for adding a language later.

5. Update the Changelog, mentioning the new version and changes.

6. Build the software package.

7. Upload the software package and the ChangeLog.

8. Notify the mailing lists and the beta testing forum of the new build.
