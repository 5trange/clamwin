</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
Each of the tabs is discussed below.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">General</H2>
<P CLASS="western">This tab has options that control ClamWin's
behaviour when scanning, and what ClamWin should do about infected
files. The <B>Scanning Options</B> control ClamWin's behaviour when
scanning. Any combination of options can be selected. The options are
as follows:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><B>Display
Infected Files Only:</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"> When
ClamWin is running a scan, it displays the names of the files as it
scans them. If this option is selected, ClamWin will only display the
names of files that have been detected as infected. Selecting this
option may slightly increase scanning speed.</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><B>Scan In
Subdirectories:</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"> Select this
option to have ClamWin scan sub-directories as well as the directory
specified.</SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><B>Display
File Scanned % Progress Indicator:</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">
If this option is selected, ClamWin will display the name of the file
that is at that moment being scanned, with the progress in
percentages between brackets. For archives, a rotating line will be
shown, indicating the scan is proceeding.</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western">The <B>Infected Files</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">
options control determine what action ClamWin should take if it
detects a virus. Only one option can be selected. The options are:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western"><B>Report Only: </B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">If
this option is selected, ClamWin only reports that a virus was found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western"><B>Remove (Use Carefully): </B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">If
this option is selected, ClamWin will <I>permanently</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">
delete</SPAN> the infected file. The file will not be placed in
Windows' Recycle Bin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western"><B>Move To Quarantine Folder:</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">
If this option is selected, ClamWin will move the <SPAN LANG="en-GB">infected</SPAN>
file to the designated folder. To change the folder, enter the path
in the text box, or click on the </SPAN><B>... </B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">button
to browse to a folder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium">If a file with the
same name is already present in the quarantine folder, then ClamWin
will append a dot followed by a number to the new file, to avoid
over-writing the existing file. E.g. if a file named <B>eicar.com</B>
is in the quarantine folder, and a virus is found in a file named
<B>eicar.com</B>, then the second copy will be moved to the
quarantine folder and renamed to <B>eicar.com.000</B>, a third copy
would be moved and renamed to <B>eicar.com.001</B>, etc.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Filters</H2>
<P CLASS="western">On this tab, ClamWin can be configured to scan
only certain types of file, or to ignore certain types of file. The
two can be combined to give greater control over what types of file
are scanned.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="config_html_m4e994d0f.png" NAME="graphics2" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=417 HEIGHT=349 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Specific files can be filtered by specifying the
full path, eg:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">C:\Path\to\folder\File.ext</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western">Folders can be filtered by specifying the path,
and including a *  at the end, eg:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">C:\Path\to\folder\*</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Note
that * will not match \, so if you want to include or exclude a
folder with all subfolders you need to use a regular expression
syntax and add .* (dot star) at the end:</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">&lt;C:<A HREF="//Path//to//folder//">\\Path\\to\\folder\\</A>.*&gt;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Regular
expressions are enclosed in &lt;&gt; tags and \\ is needed because \
is a reserved character.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Regular expressions can be used for greater
flexibility, but must be contained within angle brackets
(&lt;RegularExpression&gt;). Information about regular expressions,
including tutorials, are readily available on the web. Just use your
favourite search engine to search for <B>regular expression tutorial</B>.</P>
<P CLASS="western">By default, the following patterns are excluded
from virus scans:</P>
<P CLASS="western">*.dbx (used by Microsoft Outlook Express to store
e-mails <SPAN LANG="en-GB">etc.</SPAN>)</P>
<P CLASS="western">*.tbb (used by Ritlabs The Bat! to store e-mails
etc)</P>
<P CLASS="western">*.pst (used by Microsoft Outlook to store data)</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">Internet
Updates</H2>
<P CLASS="western">On this tab, you can control how ClamWin gets
updates to the virus database. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="config_html_m4cef558.png" NAME="graphics3" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=417 HEIGHT=349 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><B>Enable Automatic Virus Database Updates:</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">
When this option is selected, then ClamWin will automatically check
for and download database updates. How often it checks and at what
time can be set by the user.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western">If ClamWin is not running (or the computer is
switched off) at the time specified, the update will be applied the
next time ClamWin is started (which will normally be the next time
the computer is switched on). The only exception is if the update
frequency is set to &quot;workdays&quot;, in which case it won't do
anything until Monday 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium">The address of the
server to be queried can be set manually. Most users will want to
leave this at the default setting (database.clamav.net). However, if
you have a local server that mirrors database.clamav.net, you can
enter its address instead.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><B>Update Virus Database On Logon:</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">
If this option is selected, ClamWin will check for database updates
when a user logs on to the PC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><B>Notify About New
ClamWin Releases:</B> If this option is selected, ClamWin will check
for new releases.  This check is run five minutes after startup of
ClamWin, and every 24 hours after that.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Proxy</H2>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="config_html_m678936f6.png" NAME="graphics4" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=417 HEIGHT=349 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT>If
you connect to the Internet via a proxy server, enter the details on
this tab. If not, leave the details blank. Most users do not use a
proxy server, and so can safely ignore this tab.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"></H2>
<H2 CLASS="western">Scheduled Scans</H2>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="config_html_m1f3b181b.png" NAME="graphics5" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=417 HEIGHT=349 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">This tab allows the user to configure ClamWin to
run scans at certain times. Details of scheduled scans are displayed.
To add a scan, click the <B>Add </B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">button,
then set the description, frequency, time, and folder to scan. An
existing scheduled scan can be changed by clicking the </SPAN><B>Edit
</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">button, or removed by clicking
the </SPAN><B>Remove</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"> button.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium">Scheduled scans can be
activated or deactivated by clicking on the appropriate button. A
deactivated scan will not run at the scheduled time.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Email Alerts</H2>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="config_html_7e4abf93.png" NAME="graphics6" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=417 HEIGHT=349 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">To have ClamWin send an e-mail report when a virus
is detected, check the <B>Send Email Alert On Virus Detection</B>
option. Fill in the details for your SMTP server, and the details for
the message (subject, from address, to address).</P>
<P CLASS="western">Note: some SMTP servers do not require a user name
&amp; password. If this is the case, leave these settings blank.</P>
<P CLASS="western">To test the settings, click the <B>Send Test Email</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">
button.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium">When this option is
selected, ClamWin will send an e-mail report whenever a virus is
found. This e-mail will include the name of the computer that the
e-mail was sent from, and a copy of the scan log.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Archives</H2>
<P CLASS="western">ClamWin can check the files in archive files (such
as .zip files) for viruses. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="config_html_m196fea56.png" NAME="graphics7" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=417 HEIGHT=349 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">This tab allows the user to select whether or not
ClamWin should check inside archive files, and set the maximum size
of archive files to be checked, the maximum number of files to be
extracted, and the maximum number of sub-archives to be extracted.</P>
<P CLASS="western">It should be noted that scanning within archives
can slow down a scan, so disabling scanning of archives may reduce
the time taken for a scan to complete.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">File Locations</H2>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="config_html_590bc174.png" NAME="graphics8" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=417 HEIGHT=349 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">This tab allows the locations of the ClamScan
program file, FreshClam program file (the program used to retrieve
database updates) and the virus database to be altered. These values
are set during installation, and should not normally need to be
altered. <I>Do not change these settings unless you know what you are
doing</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">. If they are incorrectly
set, ClamWin will stop working.</SPAN></P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Reports</H2>
<P CLASS="western">This tab allows the user to change the location &amp;
name of the log files. Most users will not need to change these
settings.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="config_html_5a6c662.png" NAME="graphics9" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=417 HEIGHT=349 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">You can also enable or disable the display of
pop-up notification messages on this tab. By default, such messages
are enabled. Unchecking the <B>Dis<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none">play
Pop-up Notification Messages In Taskbar</SPAN></B><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">
checkbox will prevent status messages appearing when viruses are
detected, the virus database is updated, etc.</SPAN></SPAN></P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Advanced</H2>
<P CLASS="western">This tab has four settings. The default settings
will be fine for most users.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="config_html_m5e9cc22b.png" NAME="graphics10" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=417 HEIGHT=349 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><B>Treat Files As Mailboxes:</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">
If selected, ClamWin will parse all files as if they were MIME e-mail
messages (<SPAN LANG="en-GB">e.g.</SPAN> Unix/Linux mailboxes, .eml
files saved from Outlook Express). Note that non-MIME files can be
scanned with this option selected, but this will slow the scan down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western"><B>Extract Attachments and Macros from MS Office
Documents: </B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">If selected, ClamWin
will check for macro viruses in MS Office documents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western"><B>Detect broken executables: </B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">If
selected, ClamWin will check the structure of executable files and
treat corrupted executables as viruses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><B>Additional Clamscan
command line parameters:</B> If you want to use Clamscan command line
options that are not currently supported by ClamWin, you can add them
here.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><B>Limit Log File Size
To:</B> Older logs will be deleted when <SPAN LANG="en-GB">necessary</SPAN>
to keep the log file within the specified size.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><B>Scanner <U>P</U>riority:</B>
This can be set to Low or Normal, and determines how the CPU cycles
are split between ClamWin and other running applications. .The
default setting is Low which may make scans slower, but should have
less impact on other applications.</P>
