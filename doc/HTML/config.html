of the tabs is discussed below.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">General</H2>
<P CLASS="western">This tab has options that control ClamWin's
behaviour when scanning, and what ClamWin should do about infected
files. The <B>Scanning Options</B> control ClamWin's behaviour when
scanning. Any combination of options can be selected. The options are
as follows:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><B><U>S</U><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none">can
In Subdirectories:</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></B><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none">
Select this option to have ClamWin scan sub-directories as well as
the directory specified.</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-style: normal"><B><U>D</U><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none">isplay
Infected Files Only:</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></B><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none">
When ClamWin is running a scan, it displays the names of the files as
it scans them. If this option is selected, ClamWin will only display
the names of files that have been detected as infected. Selecting
this option may slightly increase scanning speed.</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-style: normal"><B><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none">Display
</SPAN><U>W</U><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none">arning
When Virus is detected: </SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></B><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none">If
this option is selected, a warning message will be displayed if
ClamWin detects a virus.</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western">The <B>Infected Files</B> options control
determine what action ClamWin should take if it detects a virus. Only
one option can be selected. The options are:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><B><U>R</U>eport Only: </B>If this option is
selected, ClamWin only reports that a virus was found.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><B><U>R</U>emove (Use Carefully): </B>If this
option is selected, ClamWin will <I>permanently</I> delete the
infected file. The file will not be placed in Windows' Recycle Bin.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><B><U>M</U>ove To Quarantine Folder:</B> If this
option is selected, ClamWin will move the infected file to the
designated folder. To change the folder, enter the path in the text
box, or click on the <B>... </B>button to browse to a folder.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium">If a file with the
same name is already present in the quarantine folder, then ClamWin
will append a dot followed by a number to the new file, to avoid
over-writing the existing file. E.g. if a file named <B>eicar.com</B>
is in the quarantine folder, and a virus is found in a file named
<B>eicar.com</B>, then the second copy will be moved to the
quarantine folder and renamed to <B>eicar.com.000</B>, a third copy
would be moved and renamed to <B>eicar.com.001</B>, etc.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Filters</H2>
<P CLASS="western">On this tab, ClamWin can be configured to scan
only certain types of file, or to ignore certain types of file. The
two can be combined to give greater control over what types of file
are scanned.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="config_html_m7d648a14.png" NAME="Preferences Window - Filters Tab" ALT="Preferences Window - Filters Tab" ALIGN=LEFT VSPACE=24 WIDTH=418 HEIGHT=349 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT>Specific
files can be filtered by specifying the full path, eg:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">C:\Path\to\folder\File.ext</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western">Folders can be filtered by specifying the path,
and including a * at the end, eg:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">C:\Path\to\folder\*</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western">Regular expressions can be used for greater
flexibility, but must be contained within angle brackets
(&lt;RegularExpression&gt;). Information about regular expressions,
including tutorials, are readily available on the web. Just use your
favourite search engine to search for <B>regular expression tutorial</B>.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Internet Updates</H2>
<P CLASS="western">On this tab, you can control how ClamWin gets
updates to the virus database. If the <B>Enable Automatic Virus
Database Updates</B> option is selected, then ClamWin will
automatically check for and download database updates. How often it
checks and at what time can be set by the user.</P>
<P CLASS="western">If ClamWin is not running (or the computer is
switched off) at the time specified, the update will be applied the
next time ClamWin is started (which will normally be the next time
the computer is switched on). The only exception is if the update
frequency is set to &quot;workdays&quot;, in which case it won't do
anything until Monday 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium">The address of the
server to be queried can be set manually. Most users will want to
leave this at the default setting (database.clamav.net). However, if
you have a local server that mirrors database.clamav.net, you can
enter its address instead.</P>
<P CLASS="western">The other option is <B>Update Virus Database On
Logon</B>. If this option is selected, ClamWin will check for updates
when a user logs on to the PC.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Proxy</H2>
<P CLASS="western">If you connect to the Internet via a proxy server,
enter the details on this tab. If not, leave the details blank. Most
users do not use a proxy server, and so can safely ignore this tab.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Scheduled Scans</H2>
<P CLASS="western">This tab allows the user to configure ClamWin to
run scans at certain times. Details of scheduled scans are displayed.
To add a scan, click the <B><U>A</U>dd </B>button, then set the
description, frequency, time, and folder to scan. An existing
scheduled scan can be changed by clicking the <B><U>E</U>dit </B>button,
or removed by clicking the <B><U>R</U>emove</B> button.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium">Scheduled scans can be
activated or deactivated by clicking on the appropriate button. A
deactivated scan will not run at the scheduled time.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Email Alerts</H2>
<P CLASS="western">To have ClamWin send an e-mail report when a virus
is detected, check the <B><U>S</U>end Email Alert On Virus Detection</B>
option. Fill in the details for your SMTP server, and the details for
the message (subject, from address, to address).</P>
<P CLASS="western">Note: some SMTP servers do not require a user name
&amp; password. If this is the case, leave these settings blank.</P>
<P CLASS="western">To test the settings, click the <B>Send <U>T</U>est
Email</B> button.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium">When this option is
selected, ClamWin will send an e-mail report whenever a virus is
found. This e-mail will include the name of the computer that the
e-mail was sent from, and a copy of the scan log.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Archives</H2>
<P CLASS="western">ClamWin can check the files in archive files (such
as .zip files) for viruses. This tab allows the user to select
whether or not ClamWin should check inside archive files, and set the
maximum size of archive files to be checked, the maximum number of
files to be extracted, and the maximum number of sub-archives to be
extracted.</P>
<P CLASS="western">It should be noted that scanning within archives
can slow down a scan, so disabling scanning of archives may reduce
the time taken for a scan to complete.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">File Locations</H2>
<P CLASS="western">This tab allows the locations of the ClamScan
program file, FreshClam program file (the program used to retrieve
database updates) and the virus database to be altered. These values
are set during installation, and should not normally need to be
altered. <I>Do not change these settings unless you know what you are
doing</I>. If they are incorrectly set, ClamWin will stop working.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Reports</H2>
<P CLASS="western">This tab allows the user to change the location &amp;
name of the log files. Most users will not need to change these
settings.</P>
<P CLASS="western">You can also enable or disable the display of
pop-up notification messages on this tab. By default, such messages
are enabled. Unchecking the <B><U>D</U><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none">isplay
Pop-up Notification Messages In Taskbar</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></B><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none">
checkbox will prevent status messages appearing when viruses are
detected, the virus database is updated, etc.</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Advanced</H2>
<P CLASS="western">This tab has four settings. The default settings
will be fine for most users.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><B><U>T</U>reat Files As Mailboxes:</B> If
selected, ClamWin will parse all files as if they were MIME e-mail
messages (e.g. Unix/Linux mailboxes, .eml files saved from Outlook
Express). Note that non-MIME files can be scanned with this option
selected, but this will slow the scan down.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><B><U>E</U>xtract Attachments and Macros from MS
Office Documents: </B>If selected, ClamWin will check for macro
viruses in MS Office documents.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><B>Limit Log File Size
To:</B> Older logs will be deleted when necessary to keep the log
file within the specified size.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><B>Scanner <U>P</U>riority:</B> This can be set to
Low, Normal or High, and determines how the CPU cycles are split
between ClamWin and other running applications. Setting this to High
may make scans quicker, but may have slow down other applications.
Conversely, setting this to Low may make scans slower, but should
have less impact on other applications.</P>
