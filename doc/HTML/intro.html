<H1>Introduction</H1>
<P>ClamWin is a graphical front-end to the <A HREF="http://www.clamav.net/" TARGET="_new">ClamAV</A>
anti-virus software that runs on Microsoft Windows. An easy to use
installer program is provided.</P>
<P>Features include:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Scheduler - set up scans to run at a defined
	time</P>
	<LI><P>Automatic virus database updates via the
	Internet</P>
	<LI><P>Standalone Virus Scanner</P>
	<LI><P>Context menu integration to Microsoft Windows
	Explorer - right click on a file to scan it</P>
	<LI><P>Microsoft Outlook add-in to scan incoming and
	outgoing e-mails</P>
</UL>
<P>Please note that ClamWin Antivirus does not
include an on-access real-time scanner, that is, you need to manually
scan a file in order to detect a virus. The Microsoft Outlook Addin,
however, will delete a virus-infected attachment automatically,
without any intervention from the user.</P>
