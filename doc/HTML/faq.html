<H1 CLASS="western">FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions</H1>
<H4 CLASS="western">Q: Why does the following message appear in
update reports, even when ClamWin is regularly updated?:</H4>
<P CLASS="monospace-western">Your ClamAV installation is OUTDATED -
please update immediately!</P>
<P CLASS="western">Solution: ClamWin uses ClamAV as its scanning
engine. This message will appear if a new version of ClamAV has been
released with important extra functionality. Upgrading ClamWin will
prevent this message appearing again.</P>
<P CLASS="western">ClamWin's automatic updates do not currently
upgrade the software itself - they just update the virus database.
The automatic software update in clamwin is being developed.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Q: Can I use ClamWin without installing it?</H4>
<P CLASS="western">A: You can create a copy of ClamWin on a CD or USB
flash drive to use on a PC that does not have ClamWin installed.
There is a tutorial explaining how to do this at
<A HREF="http://www.phillipsuk.org/howto/ClamWin-CDUSB.html">http://www.phillipsuk.org/howto/ClamWin-CDUSB.html</A></P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Q: Is a localised version available? Can I
translate ClamWin into my language?</H4>
<P CLASS="western">A: At the moment, ClamWin is only available in
English. Translating ClamWin would be difficult. However, this will
change in the future (probably around version 1.0) and features will
be added to make it easier to produce localised versions of ClamWin.</P>
<P CLASS="western">However, translated versions of the FAQ are
available in the <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/docman/?group_id=105508" TARGET="_top">Documents</A>
section of the ClamWin SourceForge.net <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/clamwin/" TARGET="_top">project</A>
web site.</P>
<P CLASS="western">If you would like to translate the ClamWin manual
and/or FAQ into your language, please contact Russ Phillips at
<A HREF="mailto:avantman42@users.sourceforge.net?subject=Translating ClamWin documentation">avantman42@users.sourceforge.net</A></P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Q: Can I upgrade an existing version of ClamWin?</H4>
<P CLASS="western">A: Yes, just run the normal <SPAN LANG="en-GB">set
up</SPAN> program, and install over the top of the existing version.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Q: Why doesn't the Integration with Microsoft
Outlook option appear during installation?</H4>
<P CLASS="western">A: This option only appears if Microsoft Outlook
is installed on the computer. Note that Outlook (which is part of the
Microsoft Office suite) and Outlook Express (which comes as part of
Windows) are two very different programs (despite the similarity in
names). ClamWin does not integrate with Outlook Express.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Q: Can ClamWin be configured to check files as
they are opened/executed (commonly known as &quot;on-access
scanning&quot;)?</H4>
<P CLASS="western">A: No. However, if the &quot;Integration with
Windows Explorer&quot; option is checked during installation, any
file can be scanned from within Windows Explorer simply by
right-clicking on it and selecting &quot;Scan For Viruses With
ClamWin&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western">This feature is being worked on, and should be
available in a later version.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Q: How can I check it works?</H4>
<P CLASS="western">A: Download the EICAR anti-virus test file from
<A HREF="http://www.eicar.org/anti_virus_test_file.htm" NAME="EICAR test file" TARGET="_top">http://www.eicar.org/anti_virus_test_file.htm</A>
This is not a virus, but a standard test file. Any anti-virus program
should recognise it and treat it as a virus. ClamWin will report it
as &quot;Eicar-Test-Signature&quot;. The file is a DOS program, and
if run it will print the message
&quot;EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!&quot;</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Q: I installed ClamWin with Outlook integration.
Why doesn't it appear in Outlook?</H4>
<P CLASS="western">A: ClamWin will not appear as an add-in. However,
if it is properly installed, an extra menu option (&quot;About
ClamWin&quot;) will have been added to Outlook's Help menu.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Q: Does it check incoming and outgoing e-mails?</H4>
<P CLASS="western">A: If ClamWin is installed with Outlook
integration, it will check all incoming and outgoing e-mails for
viruses. E-mails are checked automatically when they are opened. If
an incoming e-mail has a virus attachment, the attachment will be
replaced with a report file.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Q: How can I report a virus that ClamWin doesn't
recognise?</H4>
<P CLASS="western">A: ClamWin uses the same database as ClamAV
(<A HREF="http://www.clamav.net/" NAME="ClamAV home page" TARGET="_top">www.clamav.net</A>).
Viruses that are not in the database can be reported using the
on-line form at <A HREF="http://www.clamav.net/sendvirus.html" NAME="Form to submit virus for inclusion in database" TARGET="_top">www.clamav.net/sendvirus.html</A>.
Please make sure that you have updated your database to the latest
version before using this form. False positives can also be reported
here.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Q: Does ClamWin scan BLOBs (Binary Large OBjects)
in databases?</H4>
<P CLASS="western">A: No, the only way to do this is export the
object to a file and scan the exported file. Ideally, the objects
should be scanned <I>before</I> they are entered into the database.</P>
