<B>Check <U>L</U>atest Version</B>: This will open the default
browser at the ClamWin web site, and check the installed version of
ClamWin. The page will display a message showing the latest version
available, and whether or not the latest version is installed, along
with a link to the download page, so that a newer version can be
downloaded if required.</P>

<H2>Scheduled Scans</H2>

<P>Scheduled scans can be set up in the preferences
dialogue. If a scheduled scan is set up, ClamWin will run a scan at
the specified time, without interrupting the user. If a virus is
found, a balloon notification will appear above the system tray icon
(note: the balloon notification feature does not work in Windows 98).
The action taken by ClamWin on detecting a virus will be determined
by what has been set in the <B>General</B> tab of the preferences
dialogue.</P>

<H2>Outlook Integration</H2>

<P>If Outlook is installed on the computer, and the
<B>Integration with Microsoft Outlook</B> option was selected during
the installation of ClamWin, then ClamWin will scan all incoming and
outgoing e-mails for viruses. This is done entirely automatically,
with no user intervention required. If an incoming e-mail has a virus
attached, the virus attachment is replaced with a report file.</P>
<H2>Windows Explorer Integration</H2>
<P>If the <B>Integration with Windows Explorer</B>
option was selected during the installation of ClamWin, an extra
option (Scan For Viruses With ClamWin) will be added to the Windows
Explorer right-click menu. Right-clicking on a file or folder and
selecting this option will scan the file or folder for viruses,
providing a quick and simple way to scan suspicious files.</P>
